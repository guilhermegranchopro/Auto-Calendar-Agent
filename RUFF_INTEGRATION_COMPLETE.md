- **Performance**: Ultra-fast linting and formatting (10-100x faster than black+flake8)

### Legacy Linter Removal:
- ❌ **Removed**: black 25.1.0
- ❌ **Removed**: flake8 7.2.0  
- ❌ **Removed**: pycodestyle, pyflakes, mccabe, pathspec
- ✅ **Added**: ruff 0.11.11 (single tool replacement)

### Configuration Features:
- Line length: 88 characters (consistent with black)

## 🛠️ MAKEFILE INTEGRATION

### Status: ✅ FULLY UPDATED
Updated all Makefile targets to use ruff instead of black and flake8:

```makefile
# Old (removed)
lint: uv run flake8 *.py --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503
format: uv run black *.py

# New (implemented)
lint: uv run ruff check --fix
format: uv run ruff format
check-format: uv run ruff format --check
lint-check: uv run ruff check --no-fix
```

### New Targets Added:
- `make check-format` - Check formatting without applying changes
- `make lint-check` - Check linting without fixing issues
- `make setup-hooks` - Install pre-commit hooks
- `make pre-commit-all` - Run pre-commit on all files

---

## 🪝 PRE-COMMIT INTEGRATION

### Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Configuration File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` created
- **Ruff Hooks**: Both linting and formatting hooks configured
- **Additional Hooks**: trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, check-toml
- **MyPy Integration**: Type checking with ignore-missing-imports

### Pre-commit Features:
- Automatic ruff linting with `--fix` on commit
- Automatic ruff formatting on commit
- YAML and TOML validation
- Large file detection
- Merge conflict detection

---

## 🔍 CODE QUALITY RESULTS

### Linting Results:
- **Total Issues Found**: 499 issues initially
- **Auto-Fixed**: 441 issues (88.4% success rate)
- **Remaining**: 58 issues → 4 issues (93% improvement)
- **Final Status**: Only 4 remaining issues in Jupyter notebook (expected/ignorable)

### Formatting Results:
- **Files Processed**: 7 files
- **Files Reformatted**: 6 files
- **Status**: All whitespace and formatting issues resolved

## 📊 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON

| Tool Combination | Speed | Features | Maintenance |
|------------------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Old**: black + flake8 | Slower | Separate tools | Multiple configs |
| **New**: ruff | 10-100x faster | All-in-one | Single config |

## 🚀 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Before (Legacy):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
black *.py
flake8 *.py --max-line-length=88
```

### After (Modern):
```bash
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
uv run ruff check --fix    # Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff format         # Format code
make run                   # Start application
```

## 📝 NEXT STEPS FOR DEVELOPERS

1. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**:
   ```bash
   make setup-hooks
   ```

2. **Run Complete Code Quality Check**:
   ```bash
   make pre-commit-all
   ```

3. **Development Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Make changes to code
   make lint          # Auto-fix linting issues
   make format        # Format code
   make test          # Run tests
   git commit         # Pre-commit hooks run automatically
   ```
